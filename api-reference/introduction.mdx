## Welcome

Yanna provides a powerful API to generate and send legal documents, NDAs, and contracts. You can integrate Yanna into your existing workflows, including voice agents like Retell AI and VAPI.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using your Yanna API Key. You must include it in the request header.

```bash
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```
